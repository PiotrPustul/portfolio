         <p className="about__paragraph">
            I graduated from the Polish school of programming where I learned the necessary technologies to build modern and user-friendly websites such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm steadily expanding my knowledge by mastering the latest libraries such as Sass, React.JS, Redux, TypeScript. Since then, I've learned a lot and coding has become my passion. I've been constantly exploring the world of web development. I consolidated my knowledge by implementing my own projects.
