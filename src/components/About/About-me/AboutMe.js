            My name is Piotr Pustul. I'm 29 years old and I was born in the south of Poland in Czestochowa.<br />
            I graduated from the Polish school of programming where I learned the necessary technologies to build modern and user-friendly websites such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.I'm steadily expanding my knowledge by mastering the latest libraries such as Sass, React.JS, Redux, TypeScript. Since then, I've learned a lot and coding has become my passion.I've been constantly exploring the world of web development. I consolidated my knowledge by implementing my own projects. My greatest pleasure is creating applications in React.JS. I usually style these applications using Sass and while keeping in mind the basic principle of mobile-first.
